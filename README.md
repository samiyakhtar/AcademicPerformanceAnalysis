# Student-Academic-Performance-Analysis
This dataset assesses students' grades across three semesters (‘G1’, ‘G2’, and ‘G3’) based on corresponding features. Our objective was to predict the final grade of individual students and their likelihood of passing or failing. The target variable (‘G3’) represents the final grade a student received on a numeric scale from 0 to 20.
