# Academic-Performance-Analysis

This dataset was collected in Portugal by Professors Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva from the University of Minho. Its original purpose was to investigate the reasons behind Portugal's lagging performance in educational metrics, such as mathematics and spoken language, compared to the rest of Europe. 

The insights derived from this dataset extend beyond Portugal's educational system, offering valuable lessons for global educational outcomes. Through the analysis of this data, we aim to uncover key patterns and trends that will enable us to optimize success and enhance decision-making processes.

This dataset assesses students' grades across three semesters (‘G1’, ‘G2’, and ‘G3’) based on corresponding features. The objective was to predict the final grade of individual students and their likelihood of passing or failing. The target variable (‘G3’) represents the final grade a student received on a numeric scale from 0 to 20.

We implemented several models such as a Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression Model, K-Nearest Neighbors, and a Support Vector Machine Model. Conducting several performance evaluation metrics allowed for a comprehensive evaluation to ascertain which model was best suited for the objective and delivered the most accurate predictions.
